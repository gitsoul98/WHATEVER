Hello there I'll upload 5 basic thing's about React

1.Feature of React 
   -JSX (JavaScript XML)
   -Components
   -Virtual DOM
   -One Way Data-binding
   -High Performance
2.What is JSX ?
  -- JSX is a syntax extention of JavaScript
  -- It is used with React to describe what the user interface ssshould look like 
3. Can web Browser read JSX Directly ?
  --No bcz they are bulit to read only "regular JS" but JSX are not regular JavaScript Object 
  -- By Babel we can read this 
4.What is Virtual DOM ?
  -- DOM -> Document Object Model 
     - DOM represents an HTML document with with a "logical tree Structure"
     - "Each branch" of tree ends in a "node"--> Contain "OBJECT" 
     
     -   Light weight representation of RealDom --> Virtual Dom 
      - State Of the Object Change  ==>> VD Change the Object Instead oF updating all the object .
5. What is EVENT ?
   - An Event is an action (USER || SYSTEM may trigger)==> "Pressing Key " , "Mouse Click"
   - Naming Using camelCase 
    -- With JSX - Pass a funtion as Event Handler instead as a String in HTML .
 ++++++++++EVENT++++++++

import React from 'react';

class Simple extends React.Component {
  work() {
    alert("Good Work!");
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <button onClick={() => this.work()}>Do some work!</button>
    );
  }
}

export default Simple;

6. What is useState() in react ?

   - Built in React Hook 
          - Allows u having state variables in Functional Component 
          -  a React Hook that lets you add a state variable to your component

       const [state, setState] = useState(initialState)


7. synthetic events in React?

   - Synthetic events combine the response of different browsers native events into one API  
   - ensuring that the events are consistent across different browsers.
      The application is consistent regardless of the browser it is running in. Here, preventDefault is a synthetic event.

   function ActionLink() { 
      function handleClick(e) {
         e.preventDefault(); 
         console.log('You just clicked a Link.');
         } 
         return (
            <a href="#" onClick={handleClick}> Click_Me </a> 
                );

8. how lists work in React ?
   - We create lists in React as we do in regular JavaScript. Lists display data in an ordered format
   - The traversal of lists is done using the map() function

      const names = ['Kohli', 'Saif', 'Arun', 'Aamir', 'Arif']; 
      const listOfNames = () => { 
            const listitems = names.map((name) => 
                  <li key={name}> 
                  {name} 
                  </li> 
         ); 
         return ( 
         <ul>{listItems}</ul>
         );
         }
