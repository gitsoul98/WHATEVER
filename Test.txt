Hello there I'll upload 5 basic thing's about React

1.Feature of React 
   -JSX (JavaScript XML)
   -Components
   -Virtual DOM
   -One Way Data-binding
   -High Performance
2.What is JSX ?
  -- JSX is a syntax extention of JavaScript
  -- It is used with React to describe what the user interface ssshould look like 
3. Can web Browser read JSX Directly ?
  --No bcz they are bulit to read only "regular JS" but JSX are not regular JavaScript Object 
  -- By Babel we can read this 
4.What is Virtual DOM ?
  -- DOM -> Document Object Model 
     - DOM represents an HTML document with with a "logical tree Structure"
     - "Each branch" of tree ends in a "node"--> Contain "OBJECT" 
     
     -   Light weight representation of RealDom --> Virtual Dom 
      - State Of the Object Change  ==>> VD Change the Object Instead oF updating all the object .
5. What is EVENT ?
   - An Event is an action (USER || SYSTEM may trigger)==> "Pressing Key " , "Mouse Click"
   - Naming Using camelCase 
    -- With JSX - Pass a funtion as Event Handler instead as a String in HTML .
